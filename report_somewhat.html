  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>This audit uncovered 135 safety deficiencies across the facility, posing significant risks to personnel and operations.  Of these findings, 64 were classified as high risk, 41 as medium risk, and 27 as low risk.  A concerning trend emerged around fire and shock hazards, predominantly due to inadequate electrical installations.  Examples include overloaded circuits with undersized wiring and improperly protected distribution boards in critical areas like the control center, workshop, and logistics areas.  These issues demand immediate attention to mitigate potential fire and electrocution risks.

Several high-risk findings highlight systemic problems within the electrical infrastructure.  Recurring issues include the use of 2.5 sq mm cables with C63A MCBs, exceeding safe carrying capacity and risking overheating.  Damaged insulation, compromised cable glands, and improper cable routing further amplify these risks.  The lack of a distribution board schedule hampers effective maintenance and troubleshooting.  Additionally, the use of aluminum ladders for electrical work represents a serious shock hazard.

To address these critical safety gaps, we recommend immediate corrective actions:

* **Prioritize and rectify all high-risk electrical deficiencies within 30 days**, focusing on overloaded circuits, damaged insulation, and exposed conductors.
* **Conduct a comprehensive review and update of electrical drawings and distribution board schedules** to ensure accurate documentation and facilitate ongoing maintenance.
* **Implement a robust electrical safety training program** for all personnel working with or near electrical equipment, emphasizing safe work practices and hazard recognition.

      <h4>Insights:</h4>
      <ul>
        
          <li>* **Fire &amp; Shock Hazards Dominate:** A significant majority of the identified hazards relate to fire and shock risks (specifically, 11 out of 20 observations or 55%), indicating potential electrical system deficiencies and fire safety vulnerabilities. This necessitates a focused review of electrical installations, equipment maintenance, and fire safety protocols.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Security Building and Control Center Hotspot:** The Main Security Building – Visitors Room and the broader &#34;CONTROL CENTER&#34; Location_Norm category show a concentration of high-priority risks (scoring 12.0 on the Risk_Score scale).  This suggests a critical need for immediate attention to these areas to mitigate fire, shock, and security access risks.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Non-Compliance with Electrical Standards:** Several observations cite non-compliance with CEA MSES 2023 regulations (specifically Reg 14 relating to MCB and cable sizing), pointing to a systemic issue in electrical design and installation. This requires a thorough audit and rectification of electrical systems to ensure compliance and prevent potential hazards.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Maintenance and Compliance Gaps:**  Observations like fire alarm panel issues, non-functional smoke detectors, and unarmoured fire alarm cables indicate lapses in regular maintenance and compliance checks. Implementing a robust maintenance schedule and stricter adherence to safety standards are essential.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Material Loss Risk and Security Vulnerabilities:**  The reported copper material theft and unauthorized entry observations highlight security vulnerabilities. Strengthening physical security measures, access control systems, and surveillance mechanisms should be prioritized.</li>

      <ul>
        
          <li>Here are some insights based on the provided data:</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Fire and Shock Hazards Concentrated in Electrical Systems:** A significant portion of the high-priority risks involves fire and shock hazards related to electrical distribution boards, cabling, and earthing. This suggests a potential systemic issue with electrical system design, installation, or maintenance practices. Further investigation into the root causes within these electrical systems is crucial.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Security Vulnerabilities Exist Across Locations:**  Observations range from unauthorized access in the Emergency Control Center to inadequate security measures at the main gate and theft in the Solar Panel Yard. This indicates a need for a comprehensive security review encompassing physical access controls, surveillance systems, and security protocols.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Maintenance and Compliance Deficiencies:** Several observations highlight maintenance issues such as non-functional fire alarm panels, smoke detectors, and RCBs, along with non-compliant cabling and earthing practices.  This points to a potential weakness in preventative maintenance programs and adherence to regulatory standards.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **&#34;Main Security Building – Visitors Room&#34; a Hotspot:** This location has multiple fire and safety issues including a fire alarm panel in off condition, non-compliant cabling, and unarmored fire alarm cables. This area requires immediate attention to mitigate the concentrated risks.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **High-Priority Risks Dominate:**  A large number of observations are categorized as &#34;HIGH&#34; priority, particularly those related to electrical safety (fire/shock). This signifies the urgent need for corrective actions to address these critical risks promptly and prevent potential incidents.</li>

      <h4>Insights:</h4>
      <ul>
        
          <li>* **Fire &amp; Shock Hazards Dominate:** Fire and shock hazards represent the largest contributors to overall risk, accounting for 80% of the total risk contribution as seen in the &#34;Risk Contribution by Hazard Type&#34; chart. This highlights a significant area needing attention for mitigation efforts.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Security Building and Control Center Vulnerabilities:**  The Main Security Building – Visitors Room and Emergency Control Center/CCTV Room locations show clusters of high-risk observations, particularly related to fire and shock hazards stemming from electrical issues.  This suggests potential systemic problems with electrical installations and maintenance practices in these critical areas.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **High-Risk Observations Concentrated in Electrical Systems:** A large proportion of HIGH priority recommendations relate to electrical distribution boards, cabling, and earthing, indicating potential non-compliance with electrical codes (CEA MSES 2023) and posing immediate fire and shock risks.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Medium Priority Recommendations Focus on Fire Detection/Prevention:** Several medium priority recommendations address fire alarm system maintenance and smoke detector functionality, highlighting the need for improved fire safety practices, especially in Security and Admin areas.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Material Loss and Emergency Evacuation Concerns:**  Although contributing less to the overall risk score currently, observations regarding material theft and potential delays in emergency evacuation (due to security gate configurations) warrant attention to prevent future incidents.  These areas might become higher risk if left unaddressed.</li>

      <h4>Insights:</h4>
      <ul>
        
          <li>* **High Fire/Shock Risk in Electrical Systems:** A significant number of high-priority recommendations relate to electrical safety (MCB/cable sizing, earthing, panel maintenance), indicating a heightened risk of fire and shock hazards, especially in distribution boards. This trend necessitates urgent attention to prevent potential incidents.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Security Vulnerabilities:** Observations related to unauthorized access, inadequate security measures (alcohol checks, metal detectors), and past theft incidents highlight vulnerabilities in physical security.  This calls for a review and strengthening of security protocols and infrastructure.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Concentration of Risks in Control Centers:**  Multiple high-risk observations (electrical hazards, unauthorized access) cluster in control centers and related areas (CCTV room, emergency control center).  This concentration suggests these critical areas may require more robust safety and security measures compared to other locations.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Maintenance and Compliance Gaps:**  Several observations, including fire alarm panel issues, unarmoured fire cables, and non-functional smoke detectors, point towards deficiencies in maintenance and compliance with safety standards.  Regular inspections and adherence to prescribed guidelines are crucial.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Inadequate Emergency Preparedness:** Issues such as the security gate hindering emergency evacuation and the use of aluminium ladders near electrical equipment indicate gaps in emergency preparedness.  Addressing these issues is vital to ensuring safe evacuation and preventing accidents during emergencies. </li>

      <h4>Insights:</h4>
      <ul>
        
          <li>* **High Risk Concentration in Electrical Systems:** A significant portion of the HIGH priority risks (and thus highest risk scores) relate to electrical safety, particularly violations of CEA MSES 2023 Reg 14 (oversizing MCBs relative to cable capacity) and issues with earthing/grounding. This indicates a systematic issue requiring immediate attention to mitigate fire and shock hazards.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Fire Safety Gaps:** Recurring observations relate to fire alarm systems (battery faults, unarmoured cables, non-functional detectors) and improper storage of flammable materials.  This highlights deficiencies in both equipment maintenance and adherence to fire safety practices.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Observations like unauthorized access to the emergency control center, the need for increased security measures at the gate, and a past theft incident point to weaknesses in physical security controls that need strengthening.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Correlation of Priority and Risk Score:**  The data generally supports the intended correlation between assigned Recommendation Priority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, NONE) and calculated Risk Score. Higher priority recommendations tend to have correspondingly higher risk scores, suggesting the priority assessment framework is functioning as intended.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Control Center Focus:** A large number of observations (7 out of 20, or 35%) are located in the control center and surrounding areas (CCTV Room, CLMS Room).  This suggests either higher scrutiny of this critical area or a concentration of vulnerabilities requiring focused improvement efforts.</li>

      <h4>Insights:</h4>
      <ul>
        
          <li>* **High Risk Concentration in Control Center and Security:** The &#34;Total Risk Assessment by Location&#34; chart likely shows the highest total risk scores in the Control Center and Security-related locations. This is supported by the dataset where multiple HIGH priority risks related to fire/shock hazards (MCB/cable mismatches, RCB failure, ladder use) are found in these areas. This suggests potential systemic issues with electrical safety practices and requires immediate attention.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Fire/Shock Hazards Predominant:**  The dataset reveals a significant number of observations related to fire and shock hazards. This is reflected in the dataset&#39;s &#34;Hazard&#34; columns, with many instances of &#34;FIRE/SHOCK&#34; entries, especially within the Control Center and Security locations. This indicates a need for a thorough review of electrical installations, equipment maintenance, and safety procedures related to electrical work.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Maintenance and Design Deficiencies:**  Many issues identified relate to either maintenance and compliance (e.g., fire alarm panel off, panel cleaning needed, smoke detectors not working) or design and engineering flaws (e.g., incorrect MCB/cable sizing, earthing issues). This highlights deficiencies in both proactive maintenance practices and initial system design, suggesting areas for improvement in both preventative and corrective actions.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Security Vulnerabilities Present:** Beyond fire/shock hazards, several security vulnerabilities are evident: unauthorized ECC access, a need for increased security checks, and a reported theft incident. These observations highlight potential weaknesses in physical security protocols and the need for strengthened access control, surveillance, and security procedures.</li>
        
          
        
          <li>* **Low Priority Issues Still Matter:** While high-priority risks demand immediate action, several low-priority observations (e.g., sanitizer storage, UPS cover type, gate barrier integration with fire alarm) indicate underlying safety and operational inefficiencies. Addressing these less urgent issues can prevent them from escalating into more serious problems in the future.</li>

  <h2>Priority-wise Observations & Recommendations</h2>
  <div id="priorityContent" class="priority-section">## Key Observations:

1. **Critical Fire & Shock Safety Deficiencies in Electrical Systems:** Multiple instances of oversized MCBs paired with undersized wiring (Observations 1, 5, 9), faulty RCBs (Observation 6), missing or broken earth connections (Observations 13, 11), and use of conductive ladders near electrical equipment (Observation 8) pose serious fire and shock hazards, particularly in critical areas like the Main Security Building and CCTV Room. These deficiencies violate established safety standards (CEA MSES 2023, IS standards) and represent a high risk to personnel and infrastructure.
2. **Fire Alarm System Reliability Concerns:**  A disabled fire alarm panel (Observation 0), unarmored fire alarm cabling (Observation 2), and non-functional smoke detectors (Observations 14, 17) compromise the fire detection and alarm system's effectiveness. This reduces the crucial early warning capability for fire incidents, hindering timely evacuation and response.
3. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Unauthorized access to the Emergency Control Center (Observation 3), inadequate security measures at the main gate (Observation 4), and a recent theft incident (Observation 7) highlight security gaps that need urgent attention.  These vulnerabilities increase the risk of unauthorized activities, theft, and potential sabotage.
4. **Non-Compliance with Good Engineering Practices:**  Several observations (3, 4, 7, 10, 16, 19) point to deviations from good engineering practices related to security, emergency preparedness, and equipment protection.  These deviations, while not always immediately hazardous, create potential risks and reflect a lack of attention to detail in safety and operational procedures.
5. **Maintenance and Housekeeping Issues:**  Observations like panel maintenance and cleaning requirements (Observation 12), coupled power cable and AC drain line (Observation 15), and improperly stored flammable materials (Observation 17) indicate</div>

        "HIGH": `## Audit Observations and Recommendations

Here are some key observations and recommendations based on the provided dataset, categorized for clarity and impact:

**I. Overcurrent Protection & Cable Sizing (Critical)**

* **Observation 1:** Multiple instances of undersized cables (2.5 sq mm) connected to oversized MCBs (C63A) in distribution boards across various locations (Visitors Room, Emergency Control Center, CCTV Room). This violates CEA MSES 2023 Reg 14 and poses a significant fire hazard due to potential cable overheating.
* **Observation 2:** Damaged insulation on R&B phase conductors in the Grinder Unit power control panel (CEA MSES 2023 Reg 106.4), creating a high risk of short circuit and fire.

* **Recommendation 1 (High Priority):** Immediately replace all undersized cables with appropriately sized conductors matching the MCB rating or downgrade the MCBs to match the existing cable capacity. Verify all cable installations comply with CEA MSES 2023 Reg 14.
* **Recommendation 2 (High Priority):** Replace the damaged conductors in the Grinder Unit panel with correctly sized and insulated cables. Ensure all connections are secure and properly protected.


**II. Earthing and Grounding Issues (Critical)**

* **Observation 3:** Multiple instances of missing or faulty earthing in sockets (Security Room, WPAC - Warranty Parts Analysis Centre, Washroom), increasing the risk of electric shock (CEA 2023 MSES Reg 43).
* **Observation 4:** Lack of earthing in the Engine Fuel Test section at WPAC (CEA MSES 2023 Reg 43), posing a severe shock hazard.

* **Recommendation 3 (High Priority):**  Inspect and repair/replace all sockets with missing or faulty earthing. Verify earth continuity using appropriate testing equipment.  Ensure compliance with CEA`,
      
        "MEDIUM": `## Key Observations:

1. **Recurring Fire Safety Deficiencies:** Multiple observations relate to non-functional or missing fire safety equipment (fire alarm panel issues, non-working smoke detectors, lack of sprinklers, etc.) across various locations, including critical areas like the WPAC and canteen. This indicates a systemic weakness in fire safety management.
2. **Non-Compliance with Electrical Safety Standards:** Several electrical hazards were noted, including improper earthing, damaged cable glands, non-FLP rated equipment near flammable materials, and obstructions near gas shutoff valves. These pose significant risks of shock, fire, and explosion.
3. **Inadequate Hazardous Area Protection:** The presence of non-FLP rated equipment near biogas and diesel storage, along with improper storage of flammable materials, highlights a lack of understanding and implementation of hazardous area classification and protection measures.
4. **Lack of Preventative Maintenance:** Issues like a faulty fire alarm battery, damaged cable glands, and a damaged LPG hose valve suggest a lack of routine inspection and preventative maintenance for critical safety systems.
5. **Design and Installation Deficiencies:** Several observations point towards flaws in the original design and installation of safety systems, such as inadequate ventilation for batteries, improper cable routing, and missing earth connections.

## Recommendations:

1. **Implement a Comprehensive Fire Safety Program (High Priority):** This program should include regular inspections, testing, and maintenance of all fire safety equipment, as well as training for personnel on fire safety procedures and emergency response.
2. **Conduct a Thorough Electrical Safety Audit (High Priority):** A qualified electrician should assess all electrical installations for compliance with relevant standards, addressing issues like earthing, cable management, and hazardous area protection.
3. **Review and Update Hazardous Area Classification and Protection (High Priority):** A formal risk assessment should be conducted to identify and classify hazardous areas, followed by implementation of appropriate engineering and administrative controls to mitigate risks.
4. **Establish a Preventative`,
      
        "LOW": `## Key Audit Observations:

1. **Fire Safety Deficiencies:** Several fire hazards were identified, including unarmoured fire alarm cables, flammable materials (sanitizers) stored improperly, inadequate fire pump room housekeeping, proximity of electrical panels to fire hydrants, and a lack of redundancy for the cold storage AC unit. These deficiencies indicate a potential for fire incidents and inadequate fire protection measures.
2. **Electrical Safety Issues:**  Multiple electrical safety concerns were observed, such as poor cable routing, an unprotected UPS, earth loops in electrical panels, a forklift charger cable without a plug, and excessive bending of battery cables. These issues pose risks of shock, fire, and equipment damage.
3. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Unauthorized access to the emergency control center and insufficient security measures at the main gate (regarding alcohol, frisking, and metal detectors) highlight security vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized activities, theft, or sabotage.
4. **Maintenance and Housekeeping Concerns:**  Issues like inadequate pressure gauge calibration, storage of materials in the fire pump room, and a non-functional AC unit in cold storage indicate a lack of proper maintenance practices and housekeeping, which can exacerbate existing hazards and create new ones.
5. **Non-Compliance with Good Engineering Practices:** Many observations point to deviations from good engineering practices, particularly in cable management, electrical installations, storage of flammable materials, and fire safety arrangements. This suggests a need for improved adherence to industry best practices and regulatory requirements.


## Recommendations:

1. **Enhance Fire Safety:** (High Priority)  Address all identified fire hazards immediately. Replace unarmoured fire alarm cables with fire-rated armoured cables. Relocate flammable materials to designated storage areas. Enforce a zero-storage policy in fire pump rooms.  Install a redundant AC unit for the cold storage. Ensure adequate clearance between electrical panels and fire hydrants. Conduct a comprehensive fire safety audit and develop a corrective action plan.
2. **Improve Electrical`,
      
        "ALL": `## Key Observations:

1. **Critical Fire & Shock Safety Deficiencies in Electrical Systems:** Multiple instances of oversized MCBs paired with undersized wiring (Observations 1, 5, 9), faulty RCBs (Observation 6), missing or broken earth connections (Observations 13, 11), and use of conductive ladders near electrical equipment (Observation 8) pose serious fire and shock hazards, particularly in critical areas like the Main Security Building and CCTV Room. These deficiencies violate established safety standards (CEA MSES 2023, IS standards) and represent a high risk to personnel and infrastructure.
2. **Fire Alarm System Reliability Concerns:**  A disabled fire alarm panel (Observation 0), unarmored fire alarm cabling (Observation 2), and non-functional smoke detectors (Observations 14, 17) compromise the fire detection and alarm system's effectiveness. This reduces the crucial early warning capability for fire incidents, hindering timely evacuation and response.
3. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Unauthorized access to the Emergency Control Center (Observation 3), inadequate security measures at the main gate (Observation 4), and a recent theft incident (Observation 7) highlight security gaps that need urgent attention.  These vulnerabilities increase the risk of unauthorized activities, theft, and potential sabotage.
4. **Non-Compliance with Good Engineering Practices:**  Several observations (3, 4, 7, 10, 16, 19) point to deviations from good engineering practices related to security, emergency preparedness, and equipment protection.  These deviations, while not always immediately hazardous, create potential risks and reflect a lack of attention to detail in safety and operational procedures.
5. **Maintenance and Housekeeping Issues:**  Observations like panel maintenance and cleaning requirements (Observation 12), coupled power cable and AC drain line (Observation 15), and improperly stored flammable materials (Observation 17) indicate`,
